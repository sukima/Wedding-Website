Here is a list of silly references and terms that many might not know about. We
are geeks and we have a quirky sense of humor. We hope you do to.

## &lt;3 (Less than three)
This is an [Emoticon][emoticon] that means a _heart_ / love. You can turn the
symbol counter-clockwise 90 degrees and it looks like a heart.

## All your gifts are belong to us
Yes that is correct. The grammar is supposed to be all silly. This is a
reference to a popular internet [meme](#meme). When "Zero Wing" (a video game)
came from Japan and translated to English the translation was so bad that geeks
adopted the odd phrasing as their own and now perpetually make fun of the
translation. See the [original video][allbase]. And for the truly nerdy read
the full wikipedia [article][wikibase].

## Burnination
See [Trogdor](#trogdor).

## Exalted Reputation
In a video game called [World of Warcraft][wow] you play a character in a world
of many towns and cities. One of the objective of this game is to complete
quests for the towns and cities which gain you reputation. After months of
playing a player might gain enough reputation to receive the status of
_exalted_ for that town or city. So it is a cute joke to claim that Maddy and
myself have reached the status of exalted reputation.

## I can haz guest list nao?
A very popular website called [I Can Haz Cheezeburger](icanhazcheezeburger.com) depicts
pictures of cats and kittens with caption on them that depict what the cats are
_thinking_ They use a language called [lolcat][lolcat] which is a strange
spelling and grammar. On the lines of _baby talk_ it has become popular as a
way of being cutesy and geeky. You to can learn [lolcat](speaklolspeak.com).

## Meme
See wikipidia [article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme).

## QR Codes
QR Codes are 2D bar codes designed to be easily scanned by a computer. They are
unique in that you can store data in the code instead of just a number. This
means that you can create a QR Code that has a website address embedded in it so
that when the phone scans the code you will be presented with a web page or
message. This is very popular in Asia and is starting to become popular in the
US especially among advertisements for prints and posters. See the
wikipedia [article][QR] on QR Codes.

## Teh Interwebs
No that is not a mis-spelling. It is a goofy way of saying _the internet_.
Check out this [article][interwebs] on the Urban Dictionary for more info.

The odd spelling of the (teh) is also another goofy way of spelling the word
_the_. It came about from people typing too fast and accidentally mis-typing
the letters. Obviously many geeks accepted the mistake and adopted it as slang.
See this wikipedia [article][teh] on the topic.

## Trogdor
Trogdor is an imaginary dragon invented by [StrongBad][SBAD] who's theme song

all.

## Red shirt
"Redshirt" is a term for a stock character in fiction who dies soon after being
introduced. The term originated with fans of Star Trek (1966â€“1969), from the
red shirts worn by Starfleet security officers who frequently die during
episodes. See the wikipedia [article][redshirt].
