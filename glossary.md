## Burnination
Trogdor is an imaginary dragon invented by [StrongBad][SBAD] who's theme song
talked about how the dragon would fly around the town burning people and
things. This [internet meme][trogdor] is what started it all.

## QR Codes
QR Codes are 2D bar codes designed to be easily scanned by a computer. They are
unique in that you can store data in the code instead of just a number. This
means that you can create a QR Code that has a website address embedded in it so
that when the phone scans the code you will be presented with a web page or
message. This is very popular in Asia and is starting to become popular in the
US especially among advertisements for prints and posters. See the
[wikipedia][QR] on QR Codes.
