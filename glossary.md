## Burnination
Trogdor is an imaginary dragon invented by [StrongBad][SBAD] who's theme song
talked about how the dragon would fly around the town burning people and
things. This [internet meme][trogdor] is what started it all.

## QR Codes
QR Codes are 2D bar codes designed to be easily scanned by a computer. They are
unique in that you can store data in the code instead of just a number. This
means that you can create a QR Code that has a website address embedded in it so
that when the phone scans the code you will be presented with a web page or
message. This is very popular in Asia and is starting to become popular in the
US especially among advertisements for prints and posters. See the
wikipedia [article][QR] on QR Codes.

## Teh Interwebs
No that is not a mis-spelling. It is a goofy way of saying _the internet_.
Check out this [article][interwebs] on the Urban Dictionary for more info.

The odd spelling of the (teh) is also another goofy way of spelling the word
_the_. It came about from people typing too fast and accidentally mis-typing
the letters. Obviously many geeks accepted the mistake and adopted it as slang.
See this wikipedia [article][teh] on the topic.
