## How I proposed to Maddy

The day before Valentine's Day I told Maddy:

> "It is clich&eacute; to propose on Valentine's Day. So that is why I doing this the day before."

That is _after_ I sent her the perfect email. Just before she and I had been
sending emails back and forth of quirky, funny, amazing wedding proposals. I
took the opportunity to make this web site and then using the address
`maddywillyoumarryme.com` I created a [QR Code][1] and using Photoshop created
the following picture:

The essence of the email was that someone had a billboard with this giant code
on it that everyone could capture with their smart phones. Once decoded it
would send them to the site.

Well, in the living room Maddy opened her email and reluctantly pulled out her
cell phone to scan the photo only start dripping tears of joy and ahhh.
