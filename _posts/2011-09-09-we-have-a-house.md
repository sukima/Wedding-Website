Well it's official I need an ice pack for my hand. Good news is my penmanship is much better.

Seriously though We have closed on our house. The official recording will happen on Monday.

So we have a weekend to plan and dream while the former owners finish moving out there stuff.

Our official name for the place is **Shangri-La**.
