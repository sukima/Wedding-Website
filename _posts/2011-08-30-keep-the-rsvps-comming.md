Thank you to all of you who have RSVP'ed so far. I have to say the technology
is something pretty interesting. Maddy shouted out tonight "Hey Hun! We got an
RSVP!" At first I was about to say "How was mail delivered during the hurricane
err tropical storm?" Then I realized how easy it was for someone to RSVP on
this website! Seriously it's really easy!

Just head over to the [RSVP page]({{site.links.rsvp}}) and you can RSVP too!
