Well if your reading this I think you already know this but the website is _live_!

Anyway I'm writing this post for:

1. Shameless self promotion
2. Ego boost
3. To test it out
4. Add more content
5. Was board

Some of the highlights are:

* iPhone compatable!
* An RSS feed fr the blog so you can put ths site into your favorite news reader.
* Google analytics. (I'm watching you!)
* RSVP feature.

Please keep coming back. We will update as offten as we can.

News: Invitations are all set and we are printing them up. All we need is a
list of addresses. Do you know yours? [Email
us](mailto:weaver.devin+wedding@gmail.com). **DON'T** use the comments as the
world (That means big brother and the men in black can see it too)!
