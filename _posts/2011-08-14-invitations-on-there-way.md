So we are working like a bunch of little elves on Christmas eve to push out
these invitations. I hope you all like them.

I have to warn everyone that it was written by *geeks* and that it has a lot of
funny references that most people will not get. That is why I am making this
website to try and explain some of our more esoteric quirks.

More news to come soon so keep checking this site.
