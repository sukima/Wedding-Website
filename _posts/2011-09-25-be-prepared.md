With only seven days left it is best to get prepared. The following is a simple
list of things you need to prepare for the wedding.

## Bring Cash

When you enter the grounds you will be find a teller at the entrance collecting
a $3.00 parking fee. **IT IS CASH ONLY**

Once your parked you can replenish your wallets with a magical money dispenser
called an ATM. It charges $2.00 to withdraw.

The entrance fee is **Cash Only**. If you partake in the Faire's many food
options they too are also_Cash Only_. However, some vendors offer the use of
plastic cards.

## The Roads

The tent is located deep within the faire. You will need to travel through the
many attractions to reach the wedding tent. The path there is paved. But if you
stray from the path you will find dirt ground meaning mud with the October
weather.

The parking lot can be a little bit of a walk in dirt or mud ground.

Take a look at the [map of the faire grounds][1].

## Lavatories

There is a bath house right next to the wedding tent. _It is an outhouse_. They
are stalls but still a hole in a ground. The wash basin is located on the side
of the building with soap and paper towels.

The flush toilets and handicapped access are available farther away from the
wedding tent area. This requires some walking if you need these facilities.

## Timing and Seating

The gates open at 11 AM. We want you to enjoy the festivities and cut loose.
The only time you need to know is that Ceremony will start at 1 PM. There a few
chairs set up fr those who need them. Please offer these seats to Mother's,
Father's, Grandparents, etc. The rest are young (physically and at heart) and
can help by standing.

After the ceremony the wedding party will be taking pictures. We ask that you
take that time to seat yourself in the tent or relax. Once pictures are
completed the party will enter the tent and the food will be open and available
to all our guests.

## Bringing Food

If you were gracious enough to bring food please stop by the wedding tent.
There will be tables there to place your dish.

Thank you all and have fun.
