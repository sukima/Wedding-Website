We had our first painting party this weekend and wow! We were able to cover
the living room, hallway, two bedrooms, and part of the kitchen in less then
24 hours! There is now two coats of Killz primer on the walls and ceiling.

Maddy has done all the hard work of finding great color pallets to paint with
and the smell of cigarettes is about 85% **gone!**

We are now focusing on the wedding plans. We have found our [rings][1], Bride
and Groom gifts for the wedding party. Reception gifts for the guests. And a
wedding cake and topper.
