Well the Honeymoon is over. Which means people are eagerly waiting pictures.
Well good news is There have been plenty taken. Unfortunatly they are not done
processing. I will update as soon as I have word when it will be ready.

The Honeymoon was a well needed break. We needed some very insensive rest. The
few days after I felt like I had a huge head cold. Lots of sleep. It's pretty
impressive just how much effort is put into such an event.

For anyone searching this site for idea on your own _off beet_ wedding I hope
to write a few more posts on what and how we pulled it off.

On a plus note the faire photographer stopped by and [took pictures][1] for the
faire's website and promotions. So check out [those][1] till I get the official
ones.
