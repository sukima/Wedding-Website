## Clothing
Formal wear? Inconceivable! Seriously, we're geeks, people. Okay... so for our
wedding we might look a bit more spiffy than usual, but we encourage all our
guests to dress in whatever they feel is comfortable. Renn Garb FTW! This is a
renaissance faire; so dressing in period costumes can be fun but it is
_OPTIONAL_. Rentals are available if you so wish. Oh, and we're not responsible
for what happens if you decide to wear a red shirt.

## All Your Gifts Are Belong to Us
The very best present we can receive is your presence at our wedding and your
love and support as we embark on this adventure together. We recognize that
especially for those of you coming from far away, simply attending our wedding
will already entail spending money on travel and hotel accommodations. However,
we have two requests: The food is pot-luck so bring a dish if you can. The
entrance fees are as follows:

What manner of creature are you?    | Price |
------------------------------------|-------|
Lords and Ladies (13 and up)        | $16   |
Princes and Princesses (5-12)       | $10   |
Gnomes, Dwarfs and Trolls (under 5) | FREE  |
Horse and carriage parking          | $3    |

For those who want to go above and beyond: handmade, and second hand gifts are
welcomed and appreciated. To make it easier for the more traditional gift
givers among you, we gladly accept gift cards or you can view our registry at
