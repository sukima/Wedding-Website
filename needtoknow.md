title: What you need to know
--- 
This site, much like our personalities, is full of jokes, puns, odd references,
and just general geeky silliness. Because of this we thought it would be
helpful to offer a _no frills_ version of exactly what you need to know and be
prepared for.

This is for anyone confused by our invitation or website. This is for anyone
who is very traditional. Because our wedding is **NOT** a traditional one.
**For the less dry and full of win version of this information check out the
[about page](/about.html).**

## RSVP
You can easily RSVP [online]({{site.links.rsvp}}), calling 860-373-7588,  or by
sending in your self addressed envelope in the invitation.

## Where
Our wedding takes place at a Renaissance Faire. Which means that unlike a park
or church it is an entertainment venue. Much like a local carnival or circus
only with horses, jousting, boisterous name calling, and many people dressed in
costumes like it's Halloween.

The location is:  
**LIONS FAIRGROUNDS - 347 GILEAD STREET - HEBRON CT**.

This is a dry event. *No alcohol* at the faire.  

On October 2nd the fair grounds open their gates at _11:00 AM_ You may enter
anytime after that. It is our intention to allow you to enjoy the entertainment
that the faire has to offer which is a separate event from our wedding. The
faire expects to be paid for such entertainment and has established the
following entrance fee. Again this is the charge for the faire. Our wedding
that happens inside the faire is not part of the venue but *requires* entrance
to the faire.

Age                | Price |

Children (5-12)    | $10   |

## Clothing
Because this happens at a renaissance faire the dress code is left up for
interpretation. This means that you are free to wear what you feel comfortable
wearing (street appropriate that is). This includes but is not limited to:

- Formal dress
- Tuxedo
- Business Casual
- Casual
- Kilts and Highlander clothing
- Period clothing
- Pirate costume
- Ninja costume
- Knight costume
- Medieval costume
- Sci-Fi costume
- [Ren Garb](http://stores.renstore.com/StoreFront.bok)

The closer to medieval style you get the more appropriate it is for this venue.
So going as Cowboys and Indians will definitely attract a lot of attention,
which you might not want. A good place to get ideas is to visit the [faire
site][faire] and possibly watch a few movies for inspiration like [A Knight's
Tale][1] or [Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves][2] (for less serious movies: [Robin
Hood, Men in Tights][3] or [The Princess Bride][4]). However, since it is a
wedding, formal wear is just as acceptable.

## Ceremony
This will be a Pagan Hand Fasting ceremony. For anyone on the conservative side
we apologize but this is the best choice for us. We will be performing a ritual
where we [cast a circle][5] and create a sacred space that is then blessed. As
witnesses to this you'll see the casting and the ritual performed during the
ceremony. This functions the same as a Christian wedding. It includes a
minister and the wedding party. It is a union between two people in a sacred
and holy space. It just looks a little different then usual.

## Food and Reception
So in medieval times, everyone would gather, bring a dish so that they could
wish the new couple a happy and prosperous future.  In keeping with that
tradition we're asking family and friends to bring a dish to share with
everyone.  Just contact us and let us know what you'd like to bring if you can
bring something (we don't want twelve dishes of tuna macaroni salad).  

Generally speaking, the total headcount that we invited was approximately 100
people.  We're not asking you to singlehandedly feed 100 people, but every dish
helps!  Also, keep in mind that since we're at the Renn Faire, if you really
really want to, you can go purchase a turkey leg and party like it's 1399 :).

As for the reception, it's NOT assigned seats.  There's not cutesy table
placecards.  It's first come, first serve for a seat; however, we do ask that
you not sit on either the bride or the groom (or the wedding party).

## Gifts
Since we already asked you to pay for your way in, and we asked for food, we
*don't* really expect gifts.  If you do choose to send or bring gifts to the
wedding, we are registered at [Amazon.com]({{site.links.registry}}).  We really
just want our friends and family to come and wish us well and to celebrate our
wedding.  This is the best gift of all.
