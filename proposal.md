title: "Maddy will you marry me?"
--- 
For almost three years now, you and I have grown nearly inseparable. Through
ups and downs. Through happy and scared. In looking back I can not imagine
wanting a future without you.

You make my life better in every way. You enhance my world. I love you.

Will you marry me?

**She said YES!**
